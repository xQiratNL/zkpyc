# ZKPyC - The Zero-Knowledge Proof Compiler for Python

ZKPyC is a compiler for a subset of Python 3.10 to a Rank-1 Constraint System (R1CS) description, used by modern zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems such as zk-SNARKs. The ZKPyC compiler leverages the [CirC](https://github.com/circify/circ) circuit compiler infrastructure to produce optimized and secure R1CS constraints.

## Features

- Compile Python 3.10 code (subset defined in `zkpyc.asdl`) to R1CS.
- Export R1CS in two formats:
  1. **CirC-IR serialization**: Compatible with ZK proof system backends directly supported by CirC, such as Groth16, Mirage, and Spartan.
  2. **zkInterface format**: Compatible with ZK proof system backends that support R1CS constraints in the [zkInterface format](https://github.com/QED-it/zkinterface).
- Generate valid witnesses for the R1CS constraints.

> **Note:** This software is a proof-of-concept and has not been audited. Use with caution

## Installation

To install ZKPyC, you need a stable Rust compiler. Install directly from GitHub using the following command:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/zkpyc/zkpyc.git zkpyc-core
```

## Usage

### Compiling Python Code to R1CS

To compile a Python file into an instance of R1CS:

```bash
zkpyc <file_name> r1cs --action setup --proof-impl <groth16 | zkinterface>
```

### Generating Witness

To generate the witness for the corresponding R1CS instance:

```bash
zk --inputs <prover_inputs_file_name> --action prove --proof-impl <groth16 | zkinterface>
```

### Verifying Witness

To verify the witness or generate the verifier's zkInterface file:

```bash
zk --inputs <verifier_inputs_file_name> --action verify --proof-impl <groth16 | zkinterface>
```

## Example Workflow

### Groth16 Back-End

```bash
# Compile the program into an R1CS instance
zkpyc examples/mm.py r1cs --action setup --proof-impl groth16

# Generate the zero-knowledge proof
zk --inputs examples/mm.py.pin --action prove --proof-impl groth16

# Verify the witness in zero-knowledge
zk --inputs examples/mm.py.vin --action verify --proof-impl groth16
```

### zkInterface Back-End (Ristretto255 Scalar Field)

```bash
# Compile the program into an R1CS instance
zkpyc --field-custom-modulus 7237005577332262213973186563042994240857116359379907606001950938285454250989 examples/zkinterface.py --action setup --proof-impl zkinterface

# Generate the zero-knowledge proof
zk --field-custom-modulus 7237005577332262213973186563042994240857116359379907606001950938285454250989 examples/zkinterface.py.pin --action prove --proof-impl zkinterface

# Verify the witness in zero-knowledge
zk --field-custom-modulus 7237005577332262213973186563042994240857116359379907606001950938285454250989 examples/zkinterface.py.vin --action verify --proof-impl zkinterface
```
